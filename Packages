Description: Inspired by the Jellyfish face, NotJellyfish aims to make your Lock screen more modern, more beatiful and more useful for free.
NotJellyfish refreshes the Lock screen with a beautiful time, emphasizing the time, date and battery. You can set the colors to anything, creating a beautiful blended effect, while still retaining its legibility.
Jellyfish also adds weather to your Lock screen, so you can always view it at a quick glance. While adding this new level of information, your Lock screen retains its simplicity, avoiding a cluttered look.
